# Kolmogorov Arnold Network

## Introduction

The Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN) is a type of neural network architecture that utilizes B-spline basis functions to model complex nonlinear relationships. The KAN architecture allows for flexible and efficient learning of functions, making it suitable for various tasks including regression and classification.

In this document, we will explore how to implement a KAN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Background

The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels. The task is to classify these images into one of the ten digit classes.
